# Roadmap

### 1. plugin api/package manager

- in-app downloadable/installable snippets

### 2. save path to get to current sheet/row/cell

- remove superfluous sheets
- output .sql or .py code

### 3. website content

- front page redesign
- /features grid
- /blog of topic/design discussions
- visidata design/internals
- make separate webpages for: devops, sysadmins, hackers, git users, bioinfers, etc

### features

#### I. Interface

- mouse-ability
    - allow user to disable mouse for system copy/paste
    - clickable column headers to set type/name, click-drag to move columns/rows
    - clickable status items (including motd)
    - info mode: mouse hover describes interface components and/or shows relevant commands
- undo #141
    - start from previous sheet in commandlog
    - replay all but last command

##### minor points
#
- 'v' hide cols which have errors on cursor row
   - or should 'v' be 'toggle-visibility' on all sheets?
- 'modified' indicator on status bar, also enables quitguard
- [ColumnsSheet] show subcolumns and their parent column (for expand/contract)
- [cmdlog] add timestamp?

- graveyard sheet improvements
   - start/drop datetimes
   - number of derivative sheets (two columns, for immediate children and to any depth)
   - number of commands executed on that sheet (as a list so they can be viewed separately)

- error history with error objects
- error sheet showing row-form traceback
   - ^O to edit

#### III. Loaders and Savers

- parquet #112
- .mdb, .accdb
- google sheets
- sqlite: allow in-memory edits, ^S to commit
  - index sheet: include rows/cols; allow to be cutnpasted
  - solve "load in other thread" problem
- save canvas to .svg (canvassave_svg)
- multisave_hdf5

#### IV. other commands and features

- numeric binning for freq column and pivot table
- rowmax aggregator ( rowmax(field) gets whole row)
- add row number in hidden column on data sheets so that original (load) order can be restored
- handle timezone for datetime
- options should allow list or dict of enum values
- column helpstr (esp for non-data sheets)
- macro parameterization
- g^D bug report
- zip/unzip from dirsheet
- status rework: use logging module?  use multiple lines on overflow?
- proper dive on json

##### technical debt

- remove all asserts; possibly replace with error()

# V. other applications with a vd-like interface

- [vgit](http://github.com/saulpw/vgit) (currently v0.2)
- [vsh](http://github.com/saulpw/vsh) (unreleased)
   - vtop (includes kill/killall/ps)
   - vls (rm/mv/cp/mount/find/grep/mkdir/rmdir/ln/touch)
   - vnet (netstat)
