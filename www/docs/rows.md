## How to filter rows

1. Press `s` or `t` on the rows to filter.
2. Press

    a. `gd` to delete the selected rows.

    **or**

    b. `"` to open a duplicate sheet with references to the selected rows.  Edits performed within the duplicate sheet will also propagate to the source sheet.

    **or**

    c. `gz"` to open a duplicate sheet with copies of the selected rows.  Any changes will not affect the source sheet.

The following example uses the file [sample.tsv](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/saulpw/visidata/stable/sample_data/sample.tsv).


**Question** On which days have we sold less than 10 Binders?

1. Scroll to the `Units` column. Set the type of the `Units` column by pressing `#` (int).
2. Type `z|` followed by `Item == 'Binder' and Units < 10` to select all of the rows where the `Item` is Binder and the number of `Units` is less than 10.
3. Press `"` to open a duplicate sheet with only those selected rows.
